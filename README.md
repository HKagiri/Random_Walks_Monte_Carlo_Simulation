# Random_Walks_Monte_Carlo_Simulation
With an aim of understanding how Monte Carlo simulation works, I used a random walk puzzle to notify if I have fewer blocks from my home I will walk while if the random walk is high then ill need to ask for transport

Key Learning Outcomes:

* Created python function
* Use of for loops
* Use of conditional statements "if", "elif" , "else" 
* Importing randoms
* Define formulas that allow you to calculate the distance.

## Next Step
* Using Monte Carlo Simulation on stocks to make predictions
